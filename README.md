# Internet Speed Checker 🌐

This is a simple web-based tool to **detect your internet speed** by measuring the time taken to download an image file using **JavaScript** and **HTML**.

# Features
- Calculates:
  - Bits per second (bps)
  - Kilobits per second (kbps)
  - Megabits per second (Mbps)
- Uses a real image from the internet to measure speed
- Runs directly in the browser without any server or API

# Technologies Used
- HTML5
- Vanilla JavaScript

# How It Works
1. The script starts a timer.
2. It attempts to download an image (`https://picsum.photos/2000/1000`).
3. Once the image is loaded, the time taken is used to calculate download speed.

> ⚠️ Note: This is a **basic estimator**. Real-world speed may vary based on caching, server response time, and other factors.

# 📂 How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open the `index.html` file in any web browser
3. A popup will show your estimated internet speed
